# Dashboarding_UtilityData-
This Repository have very detailed dataflow  from Alteryx to power BI 

Executive Summary 
The objective of this project was to analyze utility usage trends, Energy, Water, and Waste, 
across multiple buildings, regions, and building types. The client is specifically interested in 
year-over-year (YoY) performance, usage distribution across regions, and building-type 
contribution. 
To meet these requirements and maintain the constraint of a 3,4 visual limit on a single page, I 
designed a focused and strategic dashboard that highlights YoY trends, regional usage, 
building-type variations, and aggregate KPI metrics.
